<!-- how images are stored? -->
<!-- they are stored by storing rgb value for each pixel for eg. if a device has 100*100 pixels each square will have rgb value. -->
<!-- if rgb value is allowed to store 3bytes memory(r-1,g-1,b-1) value in a device each rgb is in 3 bytes so 10000*3= 30kb image size. -->
<!-- So image clarity depends on this memory size as if it is allowed to store 24bytes it can store more precise value of rgb in 8 bytes each for r,g,b here-->
